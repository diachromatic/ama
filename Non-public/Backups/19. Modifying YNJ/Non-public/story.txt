Timeline
----------------

- Cave Story

- 197 unknown years

- Research done for two more years on red crystal energy

- The laboratory "Purge" - sudden annihilation of all research and murder of all researchers

* Purge committed by Ama while under crystal influence, to protect the secrets of the red crystals

* Two survivors: 2403 and research head (the latter is in hiding)

* Ama on the run for a year from research head and Raven

* (((Raven is a modified surface soldier)))

* Trapped in abandoned laboratory, tracked by Raven

* Trap program executed to destroy the red crystal within Ama completely

* Ama counters this by fragmenting the crystal and expelling it, sending it to unknown areas

* Then loses her memory, and found by Raven

- Raven and Ama investigate laboratory, finding Mushroom and finding out that the lab was researching special energy (well you would find out if you didn't stab him you piece of shit)

- Ama meets 2403

- Ama deals with Alice

- Restores power for Tech Town

- Goes to top area of Tech Town and meets research head

- Raven comes in after Ama and they talk about important shit

- Research head asks Raven and Ama to keep searching for areas filled with powerful energy because they're dangerous and need to be dealt with

* Hint: The energy instability is from the shards

- Probably kill more shit, hang out with 2403 etc

- Research head discusses a secret project named "Alternate Memory Access" with Raven and Ama and how it was a hidden pet project within the research lab

- Basically allows storage of memories for later transfer to a human (or mechanical) being

- Suggests that perhaps this project can be used to restore Ama's memory to an earlier point

* Ama's pre-amnesia state involved her having the doctor's memories (along with a strong influence from the crystal)

* Ama broke into the laboratory while under chase so as to wipe her memory using the alternate memory access (no one knows this though)

* Turns out Ama is a surface soldier; she was dormant but was found and infused with the crystal's power (I'm putting this here on the timeline because I'm not sure in which ending to explain it)


Shitty Path

----------------------------------

- If you kill a lot: after you meet with research head he asks Raven to stay behind

* Research head secretly tells her to destroy Ama - though the project is real, it is simply to lure Ama into a fatal situation

- Ama goes back to the laboratory and is trapped by Raven

- Raven explains that they had been chasing Ama for around a year after her destruction and murder within the laboratory

- Raven had hoped to change Ama, but you know mass murder killing mushrooms it didn't really work out

- Locks her in the start room, setting up a powerful explosive to level the laboratory

- AMA starts up and returns Ama's memories, sending her into a fury and screaming at Raven

- "Don't go too far, black bird! I'll only let you be killed by my hands!"

- "I'll not die by such a monster."

- Obviously Ama's dead right? Right?
