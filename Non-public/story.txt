BACKSTORY
_________

* Did you know that the witch-woman Mushroom Kid once had a sister? Her name was Raven.

* Ama = Misery descendant

* Ama/Raven childhood friends

* Ama's lineage causes reaction with crystal, subject of research

- Early childhood, Ama reacts violently with crystal, fatally wounding Raven

- Highly experimental AMA is used to fix Raven, but not without errors

- Fixing Raven and securing crystal becomes super secret research of factory

- Later, Ama snaps, starts the Purge

- RD escapes

- 2403 initiates emergency lockdown, leaving him with the guilt of this action for long time

- "How could you do this again?"

- Shit breaks down

* Raven's first memory is stabbing + Purge

- Raven leaves facility, heads to Tech Town on directions from a kind stranger (2403)

* Mayor of Tech Town (RD) keeps watch over Raven as she matures

* Mushroom Kid in the meantime chills with Rikei

- Raven decides she wants to find a key to her memories (Ama) and heads to the facility

- Finds Ama


MAIN PATH
_________

- Raven and Ama investigate laboratory, finding Mushroom and finding out that the lab was researching special energy (well you would find out
  if you didn't stab him you piece of shit)

- Ama meets 2403

- Ama deals with Alice

- Restores power for Tech Town

* BIG SHIFT

- Goes to top area of Tech Town and meets research head

- Raven comes in after Ama and they talk about important shit

- Research head asks Raven and Ama to keep searching for areas filled with powerful energy because they're dangerous and need to be dealt with

* Hint: The energy instability is from the shards

= Mid-game areas

* While searching, bring shards to RD

- After specific shards have been gathered, they fuse, causing a power surge once again shutting off Tech Town

* BIG SHIFT

- Only other source of power is facility

- Before they leave for the facility, Research head discusses a secret project named "Alternate Memory Access" with Raven and Ama and how it was a hidden pet project within the research lab

- Basically allows storage of memories for later transfer to a human (or mechanical) being

- Suggests that perhaps this project can be used to restore Ama's memory to an earlier point

* BIG SPLIT

AMA (IN PROGRESS)
_________________

* "Bad" ending

- If you kill a lot: after you meet with research head he asks Raven to stay behind

* Research head secretly tells her to destroy Ama - though the project is real, it is simply to lure Ama into a fatal situation

- Ama goes back to the laboratory and is trapped by Raven

- Raven explains that they had been chasing Ama for around a year after her destruction and murder within the laboratory

- Raven had hoped to change Ama, but you know mass murder killing mushrooms it didn't really work out

- Locks her in the start room, setting up a powerful explosive to level the laboratory

- AMA starts up and returns Ama's memories, sending her into a fury and screaming at Raven

- Obviously Ama's dead right? Right?
